The most reliable solution is to avoid using `@apply` within style attributes altogether. Instead, create dedicated CSS classes that combine the desired styles and apply these classes directly to the elements.

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 rounded-lg p-2">
    This text is now consistently blue and rounded.
  </div>
</div>
```

This approach ensures that styles are consistently applied and avoids the unpredictable behavior associated with `@apply` within style attributes.  The use of dedicated classes improves maintainability and readability of your CSS code.
